JAVA: OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Create a Basic JavaScript Object:
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};

Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object:
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Only change code below this line
console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.numLegs);

Create a Method on an Object:
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() { return "This dog has " + dog.numLegs + " legs."}
};
console.log(dog.sayLegs());

Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword:
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
};
dog.sayLegs();

Define a Constructor Function:
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rex";
  this.color = "Black";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

Use a Constructor to Create Objects:
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// Only change code below this line
let hound = new Dog();
console.log(hound);
