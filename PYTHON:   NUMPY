PYTHON:   NUMPY
Start March 10, 2023

What is NumPy - Why are Numpy arrays faster than regular Python lists? ----------------------------------------------------------------

Numpy does not perform type checking while iterating through objects.  Numpy uses fixed types.  Numpy uses contiguous memory.
All of the above.
