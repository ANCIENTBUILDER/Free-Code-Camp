JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Escape Sequences in Strings:
const myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";

Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator:
const myStr = "This is the start. "+"This is the end.";

Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator:
let myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence."

Constructing Strings with Variables:
const myName = "Rik";
const myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";

Appending Variables to Strings:
const someAdjective = "the bomb";
let myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;

Find the Length of a String:
lastNameLength = lastName.length;

Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String:
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line

Understand String Immutability:
myStr = "Hello World";

Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String:
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];

Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String:
const lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];

Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String:
const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length -2];

Word Blanks:
const wordBlanks = "My " + myAdjective + " " + myNoun + " " + myVerb + " " + myAdverb + ".";
