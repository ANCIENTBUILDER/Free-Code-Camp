DEBUGGING JAVA

Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable:
let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this line
console.log(a);
let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);

Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console:
let output = "Get this to show once in the freeCodeCamp console and not at all in the browser console";
console.clear();
console.log(output);
console.clear();

Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable:
let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);

Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable:
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);
