        <p>World renowned and respected for his informed intelect, writings, and public speaking events, the former media personality is best known for his views on "who and what is really controlling the world".  
        <p>One of the most intelligent and controversial authors in the world, he has written 20+ books with facts and evidence that represent an educated and informed perspective.</p>  
        <p>Attracting a substantial following across the political spectrum with his publication of "And the Truth Shall Set You Free" (1995), followed by his 533-page "The Biggest Secret" (1999), which has been called the conspiracy theorist's Rosetta Stone.</p>

        <p>Icke was a well-known intelligent and articulate BBC television sports presenter and spokesman for the Green Party.</p>

        <p>With four books published over seven years - The Robots' Rebellion (1994), And the Truth Shall Set You Free (1995), The Biggest Secret (1999), and Children of the Matrix (2001) - Ike set out a moral and political worldview of meritocracy and integrity. At the heart of his theories lies the idea that a Shadow Government controls humanity, which is supported by mountains of evidence, facts and data that refute mainstream media's attempt to spin a dangerous and false narrative to the general public, even going so far as to delete information (evidence) from the internet.</P>  

        <p>Icke has been criticized for raising attention to "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" - a 1903 Russian perspective purporting to be a plan by the Jewish people to achieve world domination, further supported by the "Talmud" and the World Economic Forum's declaration of war on humanity and all of God's creation in the name of their god Satan. Icke strongly denies there is anything antisemitic about this, truthful evidence and facts say volumes, which has even beed confirmed by the Grand Jury Court of Public Opinion (2023).</p>  

        <p>Mr. Ike is consistently protrayed by mainstream media as a whacked out nut job, but this could not be farther from the truth, as Ike continues to blow the whistle on the most clear and present threat to humanity, and all of God's creation.</p>
